# Identity and Data Security for Web Development

Examples and exercises as I work through [Identity and Data Security for Web Development by O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/identity-and-data/9781491937006/). Topics covered include:

- Hashing functions and salt
- Using captchas
- Browser fingerprinting
- OAuth2
- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Hardening web applications including
  - Content security policies
  - XSS
  - HTTP Public Key Pinning
  - HTTP Strict Transport Policy
  - Client-side caching
  - MIME type sniffing

Note, this doesn't cover SSL/ TLS and PKI as I am using the 'Bulletproof SSL/ TLS' book for that.

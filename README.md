# Identity and Data Security for Web Development

Examples and exercises as I work through Identity and Data Security for Web Development by O'Reilly. Topics covered include:

- Hashing functions and salt
- Using captchas
- Browser fingerprinting
- OAuth2
- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Hardening web applications including
  - XSS
  - 

Note, this doesn't cover SSL/ TLS and PKI as I am using the bulletproof SSL/ TLS book for that.
